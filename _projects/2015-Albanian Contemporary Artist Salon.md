>Aims of the salon ACAS – Albanian Contemporary Artist Salon are to promote the work of a selection of Albanian emerging contemporary artists in Albania, in France and at an international scale, by organizing a two-weeks event in Tirana and inviting international professionals to experience the artworks of contemporary Albanian artists during the Salon.
ACAS – Albanian Contemporary Artist Salon will take place in the exhibition galleries of the National Museum of Tirana at the beginning of November 2015.
The selection process was done in Tirana by an independant jury of art professionals : Mrs. Christine Macel – chief curator of the Centre Pompidou, Mrs Alicia Knock – curator for the Centre Pompidou Mrs Alicia Knock and Mr Sâadane Afif – French artist.
This selection reflects the liveliness and diversity of the Albanian artistic scene, and all media and techniques are present, from painting to drawing, from installation to video and film.
