> In 1992, the Soros Foundation organized an exhibition of paintings, because that was the only known medium at the time. This was the first moment where you could see some different tendencies (let's not call them new). There was this huge gap of information since the mid-fifties between Albania and what was going on elsewhere in the world. All these people were raised according to the socialist realist methods. Artists, which are supposed to be a rebel, having suffered a lot under this cruel regime, scarcely dared to take the ship and get to Italy. So in 1992, in this first exihibition, artists tried to escape reality. No escape from the country (because they did not have the courage), but an escape from the known schemes into formalism. It was a revival of abstract painting, looking outmoded, if you put it out of it's context.

>Nobody thought of concepts and ideas, everybody fought against them. Take for example Edi Hila, one of the greatest Albanian artists and the former dean of the Fine Art Academy, who had a series of abstract paintings. Nobody could get out of this revolt against conceptuality and realism. But Hila's work was to a certain extent influenced by the Tirana environment, which in the early nineties was completely destroyed. Or Vladimir Myrtezai, an artist in his mid-thirties, who has recently made some installations. But he also comes from a painting background. He has been one of the first formal artists, using pure geometrical, abstract forms. Gazmend Leka is also a painter, who produced around 1992 a series of abstract graphics with some figurative elements. Now he is dealing in the paintings with religious characters, even though it is abstract.
