Construction of a children's playground as a "pilot project" in a protected natural zone. Caused months of civil protest, only later to appear to be part of larger plan Bolles + Wilson to build much more inside the park.

The playground was constructed by Startek shpk and partners (including subcontractor Kassel shpk), whose CEO, Lulëzim Mehmetaj, is the husband of Besjona Dedë Mehmetaj, the General Director of Social Services at the Municipality of Tirana under Erion Veliaj. Other contractors were Riviera shpk and Kaleshi shpk
