Organized in the National Gallery of Arts, under the auspices of the Ministry of Tourism, Culture, Youth, and Sport.
The first Onufri exhibition under the new Sali Berisha government, and without the collaboration of any of its three initiators: Edi Rama, Edi Muka, and Gëzim Qëndro. For the coming years, there is a resurgence in reactionary art, marked by a decreasing participation of international artists and a curatorial preference for traditional art practices.
