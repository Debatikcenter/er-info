Many unknowns about this competition, most probably not held by Edi Rama.
The Bank of Albania was built in 1937 by Giovanni Michelucci.

Petreschi was also commissioned, illegally without tender, to [restore Hotel Dajti](http://www.marcopetreschi.com/project/hotel-dajti/), the famous socialist hotel in central Tirana, which former PM Sali Berisha had sold to Bank of Albania for â‚¬30M in February 2010.
