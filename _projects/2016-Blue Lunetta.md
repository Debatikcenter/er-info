Public intervention in Mantova, in which Edi Rama painted a former industrial building blue. Lorenza Baroncelli is both councillor to Rama and to the Mayor of Mantova, and later curated the show in Naples featuring this work.

The work is clearly inspired by Bolles + Wilson's "Blue House Square" in Kor√ßa, designed in 2015.
