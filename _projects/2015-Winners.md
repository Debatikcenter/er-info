[According](http://www.alastaircampbell.org/blog/2014/07/12/albania-me-and-the-sun-on-sunday-a-little-context-via-prebutttal/) to Alastair Campbell:
>Edi Rama is likely to feature in the new book as he has been a winner both in sport and politics â€“ I think he is the only current PM or President who has played international sport for his country.

*Winners* contains an entire chapter on Edi Rama as "team player."
