The competition was opened in 2009, under the mayorship of Niko Peleshi, who later became Deputy Prime Minister. As a result, Bolles + Wilson received many government tenders and in return refurbished Peleshi's office.

The "Red Bar" tower was built by Eurocol shpk, and subsequently Bolles+Wilson has made several interventions in Korça public space, including the "Blue House Square."
