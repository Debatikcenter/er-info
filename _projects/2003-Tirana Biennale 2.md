After directing the 1st Tirana Biennale in 2001, Giancarlo Politi intended on moving his low-budget biennale to Prague. This idea was resisted by his Albanian collaborators, and the second biennale was held without him. In 2005, Politi started a court case in Albania over the copyright on the name "Tirana Biennale." However, owing to a mistake of his lawyer, the name was registered under *Gianfranco* Politi, who turned out to be a factory owner from Perugia (check) happy to concede the name to the Albanian organizers.

The 2nd Tirana Biennale included the project "Tirana Façades," a follow-up on Edi Rama's "Greening and Painting" project including façades designed by Olafur Eliasson, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Liam Gillick, Rirkrit Tiravanija, and Bolles + Wilson, Architecture Studio, and Roueïda Ayache.

Curator of W139, Ann Demeester, invited Sagi Groner, Gregor Schneider, Jota Castro, Jean Bernard Koeman, Effi en Amir, and Orgacom.

>Utopia: (gk. nowhere land); an imaginary island described in Sir Thomas More’s Utopia (1516) as enjoying perfection in law, politics, etc, any ideal place or state; any visionary system of political or social perfection.

>The fall of the last big Utopia, Communism, and the establishing of Capitalism as the only World Order, made Fukuyama proclaim the end of History. What has occurred recently has seriously questioned his thesis while the end of history is not yet in sight.

>The fall of universal and monolithic ideologies has dematerialised the topos , making it an impossible topos (place), while claiming that the only true topos is U­Topos, it is YOU and yourself as THE TOPOS, it is your personal realm where your dreams and hopes come true. Is there a Utopia today, and if so, is it more a personal or a collective one? How does today’s artist deal with imagination and memory; how does he get access to both private and collective memory, in its static and dynamic forms? In these times of great structural changes of the collective mind and rapid globalisation, the artist's task is to make people aware of such changes and create the new decors and sensory experiences connected to them and discover the suitable metaphorical artistic language. On the other hand, are we living in a world where laic or religious messianic message is outdated? Is the art of today able to convey such messages and is our society really interested in them?

>Art today is not anymore a reflection of any utopian reality but the only topos where still exists a possibility of dreaming; the only possible topos which reflects the inner beliefs, truths and doubts; the land of impossible promises or the promise of the impossible, the unreachable realm of unrealistic social and political projects, together with its collective dreams and universal beliefs.

>p.s. ...we regret to tell you that our art foundation can’t finance the Biennale of Tirana, simply because we don’t believe that an event of such proportions can take place in Albania”. Sincerely yours....

>This was the official answer of a foreign foundation to our request for financial help. Like Saint Thomas, they wanted to see the proof before believing in resurrection. We must admit that partly they were right. How can you expect someone to believe in a sign of resurrection, (as the Biennale certainly is), of collaboration, hope and tolerance, normality and common values, in a country crucified for so long by isolation, disgrace, intolerance, abnormality and provincialism?

>This is an excerpt taken from one of the texts of the catalogue of the 1st Tirana Biennale. The first Biennale already took place, with its many problems and excitements. Organizing the second one is again a reason to generate the same disbelief, the same doubts and the same reactions, many of which proved to be wrong already. Tirana, together with its lack of hope, disgrace and intolerance, abnormality and provincialism, and its Biennale too, seems to be the U ­ topos, the place that best fits the desire and the need to dream.
