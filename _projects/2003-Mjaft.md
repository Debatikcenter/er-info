Grassroots movement funded by George Soros's Open Society Foundation and the Dutch Embassy, which for a period was one of the few independent civil society movements in Albania. After failing to lastingly influence national politics, several members of MJAFT! founded the political party G99 in 2007, which later merged with the Socialist Party.

It is generally believed that many of the leading members of MJAFT! funneled donations into their private companies, including CP&R, Grafik Propaganda (registered by Erion Veliaj's brother ArbÃ«r), and the Albanian Communication Group sh.p.k. founded on June 25, 2008 by Arbjan Mazniku (30%) and Endri Fuga (70%) with a starting capital of ALL 11,000,000. Many former MJAFT! members are currently in prominent positions in the Rama government. Since 2007, MJAFT! has had no longer has any significant impact on the Albanian public debate.
