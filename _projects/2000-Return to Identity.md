As part of Edi Rama's ambitious project as mayor of Tirana "Return to Idenity," "Greening and Painting" aimed to intervene in the urban structure by painting the fa√ßades of the communist housing blocks in bright colors. This project was captured in  Anri Sala's famous movie *Dammi i colori* (2003) with an opening quote by Liam Gillick, "please tell me you don't have an artist-mayor friend." *Dammi i colori* was subsequently included in the "Utopia Station" project by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Molly Nesbit and Rirkrit Tiravanija.

"Greening and Painting" would have many iterations: during the 2nd Tirana Biennial in 2003, the Tirana International Contemporary Art Biannual in 2009, and recently with a series of repaintings initiated under current Mayor of Tirana Erion Veliaj.
