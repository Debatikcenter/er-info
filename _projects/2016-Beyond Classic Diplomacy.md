>The task of promoting a favourable image abroad traditionally lies within cultural diplomacy, as an indispensable tool to ensure stable relations with other countries, thanks to the promotion of cultural life at international level, by means of traditional diplomacy and the growing impact of public and digital diplomacy. The first problem encountered by our cultural diplomacy is how to present Albanian culture abroad, by reconciling national promotion with new needs stemming from globalization and the progress of European integration. In this context, the Albanian communities in the world constitute a multifaceted resource, which has yet to be fully explored and used appropriately to the benefit of the overall development of the country and the empowerment of the Albanian Diaspora. National institutions, and in particular the Foreign Service, are developing an innovative and functional relationship, establishing authentic communication, cooperation and interaction bridges with the Albanian communities worldwide. To the same end, the consular services reform seeks to reposition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as an institution that provides transparent and low cost services to Albanian citizens. In this regard, recent improvements in the legal framework, simplification of practices and modernization of infrastructure have increased the speed and quality of consular services.
