>“Arena” consists in the presentation of the video with the same title of Anri Sala realized in 2001 at area of Tirana Zoo. In “Arena” Sala comprises only location shots of a site whose function cannot clearly be identified. Long corridors with glass walls open on to a lawn upon which stray dogs rest lethargically. Repeated faint animal noises of an exotic nature are audible. Time runs empty in this place outside the social world. This is the first project of Gallery On The Move exhibitions program at The Promenade Gallery in Vlora.
