>How can agriculture, tourism and spatial planning work together in a circular model, adding maximum value to a sustainable year round local economy? Experts from the Netherlands, Italy and Switzerland and Arber Togani, winner of Master Chef Albania, have explored combinations and collaborations between the agricultural sector, production and processing, the tourism sector and spatial design. A great number of local stakeholders have teamed up for this project- with the international experts and business people who have worked on a model for tourism and agriculture, integrating the sectors where possible and working on profitable business models for individual entrepreneurs. Getting to the core of the uniqueness and traditions of the area while looking for ways to innovate at the same time.
