Renovation of the former Sigurimi headquarters in Tirana, known as the "House of Leaves," turning it into a museum. Ironically, the museum that will address the inner workings of this most feared communist security service will be curated by Bashkim Shehu, son of Enver Hoxha's Prime Minister and right hand Mehmet Shehu.

The expert committee advising on the renovation consists of Fabian Kati, Gëzim Qëndro, Artan Puto, and Eldon Gjika.
