>Looking at the landscape from the airplane, as from the satellite, entire portions of the urban territory appear to us completely built. From above, a city is a spotted body. Its solid geographical connotations has been retouched by a liquid grain of urban matter, which has bypassed saddles, flooded plains, filled valleys. From above we see not only the space, we also see the time. We see the results of a phenomenon of extension of the living space that in the last three decades has transformed our urban geography.
But when you cross cities by car or train, leaving the town centres, moving to their edges, the same disrupted landscapes tell a different city that has changed rhythm. The "new", everything that was built after the early seventies, has the appearance of molecular building block in the center of a land plot. The new urban rhythm is set by a multitude of solitary buildings of a society where the forms of elementary cohesion—the family, the association, the chain stores, the small enterprise— have acquired over the last thirty years the financial and legal resources to build their own portion of space, its urban "monad“ facilitated by tax incentives and wide meshes of a very complicated web of regional, provincial, municipal and sub-municipal rules.
But you only see the more faithful urban landscape, breaking away from the ground, but not turning away too much. From a intermediate look between the zenith gaze and the subjectivity of crossing, cities reveal the frames and the infrastructures that hold together the multitude of his built monads. More often these "integral" lumps do not require the physical proximity; simply, are connected and held in tension by the threads of the new communications assets.
The landscape of the islands, fences, rhizomes, cuttings, bubbles, plates, that appear from an helicopter show us a city as the product of a society where the institutions, businesses, free associations, political and illegal clans, but also individual communities of citizens, compete in governing limited areas of territory. If space was really the best metaphor of our social life, the landscapes observed from an intermediate height show us the unfolding of a society where prevails a imperfect polyarchy, that has shaped the land in his own image and likeness.
