Former nuclear bunker of the Central Committee in the outskirts of Tirana, transformed into a tourist attraction by Carlo Bollino's Spazio Eventi. The Ministry of Culture accorded a budget of €100,000 without an official tender procedure. Until March 2016, Bunk'Art was officially managed by the Ministry of Defense, when management was transferred to an NGO "Qendra Ura," administered by two associates of Carlo Bolino, and with no previous experience in managing cultural heritage sites.
