This exhibition is the return of Giancarlo Politi to Albania, where he now meets Edi Rama, then Minister of Culture, and pitches his idea for a low-budget Biennial. A year later he organizes the presence of Albania in the Italian Pavilion at the 48th Venice Biennial under the title "Albanian Today." He also brings Francesco Bonami to Tirana, who will later co-curate the Manifesta 3 in Ljubljana, including many artists also present at Onufri 1998. The low-budget biennial proposes by Politi materializes in 2001 as the First Tirana Biennial.

[Edi Muka](http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0108/msg00134.html):
> After this show, together with Giancarlo Politi and Edi Rama we took the
decision to start working on the first edition of the Tirana Biennial.
That's my main occupation since then, till the opening scheduled for
September 15th 2001.

[And](http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0008/msg00042.html):
>Everything started happening after the first international show we did
in Tirana in 1998. After that the Venice Bienale came, and apart from that
we were on the "five minutes of attention" of the world. Luckily, and
because of seriously good work and presentation, we could make the brake
through. From that moment on many shows started taking  place
internationally, while some of the artists could see immediate impact of
their work. This is the case with Anri Sala for instance, Adrian Paci and
Sislej Xhafa.

In March 1999, Edi Muka gives a [lecture](https://english.sta.si/394866/albanias-edi-muka-to-speak-about-permanent-instability-of-the-balkans) in Ljubljana on "Permanent Instability," at the Ljubljana SOROS centre for contemporary art.
