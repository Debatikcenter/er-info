Onufri as an annual exhibition has existed since 1993, and basically allowed anyone to send in work of any type of quality, which was subsequently exhibited in the National Gallery of Arts. This practices changed in 1997, when Gëzim Qëndro was appointed director and *curated* the Onufri of that year, reducing the hundreds of works to an exhibition of about sixty – to great uproar and scandal.

In 1998 a prize became attached to the annual Onufri exhibition through a decision of the Council of Ministers. The Onufri 1998 "Permanent Instability" exhibition was one of many firsts. It was the first exhibition in Albania with a *curator*, Edi Muka, the first which included a host of *international artists*, and the first that was organized as a *competition* – a form that would later find its way into Rama's urbanism policies.

This exhibition also saw the return of Giancarlo Politi to Albania, where he now meets Edi Rama, then Minister of Culture, and pitches his idea for a low-budget Biennial. A year later he organizes the presence of Albania in the Italian Pavilion at the 48th Venice Biennial under the title "Albanian Today." He also brings Francesco Bonami to Tirana, who will later co-curate the Manifesta 3 in Ljubljana, including many artists also present at Onufri 1998. The low-budget biennial proposes by Politi materializes in 2001 as the First Tirana Biennial.

[Edi Muka](http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0108/msg00134.html):
> After this show, together with Giancarlo Politi and Edi Rama we took the
decision to start working on the first edition of the Tirana Biennial.
That's my main occupation since then, till the opening scheduled for
September 15th 2001.

[And](http://www.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0008/msg00042.html):
>Everything started happening after the first international show we did
in Tirana in 1998. After that the Venice Bienale came, and apart from that
we were on the "five minutes of attention" of the world. Luckily, and
because of seriously good work and presentation, we could make the brake
through. From that moment on many shows started taking  place
internationally, while some of the artists could see immediate impact of
their work. This is the case with Anri Sala for instance, Adrian Paci and
Sislej Xhafa.

In March 1999, Edi Muka gives a [lecture](https://english.sta.si/394866/albanias-edi-muka-to-speak-about-permanent-instability-of-the-balkans) in Ljubljana on "Permanent Instability," at the Ljubljana SOROS centre for contemporary art, the same city where in 2000 Manifesta 3 was organized.

The many ideas about contemporary art entering Albania from 1998–2005 – curating, the differentiation between group and solo shows, catalogue production, art theory, collateral programming, video, multidisciplinary education, conceptual art, biennales – however never took hold in the Albanian cultural climate, owing to the persistent resistance from the post-WWII generation of artists, which had reached maturity under the socialist regime, still (until today) dominated the Academy of Arts, and had "missed" both the wave of the historical avant-garde and of conceptual, postmodern art. Combined with the electoral victory of right-wing PD leader Sali Berisha (who had brought Albania to economic collapse and on the brink of civil war in 1997) in 2005, the annual Onufri exhibition was in steady decline. As an illustration, Onufri 2010 was won by Gazmend Leka, Director of the Art Academy and emblem of conservative art practices. The exhibition ceased to be held in 2014, when Minister of Culture Mirela Kumbaro called for a "break." The restart in 2015 was considered a non-event, and no curators applied to curate the show in 2016.
