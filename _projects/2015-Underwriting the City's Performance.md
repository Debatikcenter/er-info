>More than half of the planet’s population are now living in cities. This vast global trend towards urbanization that is underway encompasses a surge of new and old metropolises that are in the process of developing. Decisive to the city’s performance, liveability and sustainability for future generations and underwriting this development is the urban landscape.
The work of MSP demonstrates a deep commitment to this realm, both public and private, yet raises the ante to propose that the contemporary urban landscape must go beyond the traditional typologies and embrace all aspects, sectors and territories of urban life especially the utilitarian spaces that characterize the city. The whole idea of landscape in the city needs to be expanded beyond the normal idea of parks and decoration or even green roofs. We must consider that most of our urban environments consist of streets, sidewalks, utility corridors, parking lots and everything outside the buildings. Little value is invested into them. MSP through their design practice urges these settings to become humane and imaginatively detailed so that in the process we positively activate public and private territories with design qualities that bring delight, beauty, nature and playfulness to the city.
