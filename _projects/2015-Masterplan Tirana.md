After the territorial reform, the Ministry of Urban Development opened a series of tenders to draft masterplan (or general local plans) for all the new municipal units in Albania.

Stefano Boeri's plan is called "A Kaleidoscopic Metropolis." It incorporates the Faith Park project by UNLAB, which has been rechristened "World Park," and the Tirana Boulevard extension until the Tirana River from the 2014 Masterplan, designed by Grimshaw Architects.

Contrary to nearly all other competitors, Stefano Boeri and UNLAB only competed for the Tirana Masterplan, and won.

Contract signed on February 3, 2016.
