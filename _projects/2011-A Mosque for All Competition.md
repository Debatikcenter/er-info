First attempt by Rama to create a monument to Religious Harmony. The Faith Park project is its second incarnation. As a mosque, it was rejected by the Muslim Community, which eventually got a new mosque at the corner of the Lana and the Small Ring, designed in [neo-Ottoman style](http://acp.al/profil_projekt.php?id=115).
