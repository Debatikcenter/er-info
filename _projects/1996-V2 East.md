Organized by Inke Arns and Andreas Broeckmann during the DEAF Festival in Rotterdam, September 1996.

This event facilitated the first meeting between Geert Lovink and curator Edi Muka. They met another time a year later in Ljubljana during the Nettime conference "Beauty and the East," and during Dokumenta X in Kassel in the Hybrid Workspace. Meanwhile, their encounter led to a series of exchanges and reports published on [Nettime](http://www.nettime.org/), which give a fascinating insight into the "beginnings" of the Albanian art scene at the turn of millennium:

According to Edi Muka's [account](http://v2.nl/archive/articles/media-art-in-albania-first-steps/?searchterm=edi%20muka) of the event, he showed one of Anri Sala's first video works:
>Media art has only just started. I can mention a young artist, his name is Anri Sala, he used to come from a painting background, shifted to installations, worked with photography and has just produced two videos, a 20 minutes long piece called 'The Tongue', which I showed here at DEAF. He also produced a computer show recently.
