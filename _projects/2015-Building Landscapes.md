Most often one starts building a landscape with an idea, a draft, a project raising several questions I would like to address through the sampling of some of the experimentation I have followed. One question is general. It points at the process through which a landscape design project is shaped, from the first moments of its existence to its long-awaited emancipation and interaction with the public sphere. Another one is more specific. It lies in the complex dialectics of breaks and continuity challenging the project-making behind the scenes. What is the nature, impact, of incidents occurring at different stages of a project: the commission's fragmentation; political, cultural, and socioeconomic conjuncture; the failure of some well-established mechanisms in project-making? Despite all such incidents or thanks to them, the project−which never exists in a pure state−transcends, at some point, ideas to become reality. I would like to evaluate what is at stake in such a metamorphosis. And finally, I would like to highlight the ways a landscape comes to be designed and built through desire. I will share with you some of the avenues of my own aspiration to landscape: stepping outside the typical framework of conceptual and technical aims and limits to reach the liberty of forms and the new social and cultural realities it opens to.
