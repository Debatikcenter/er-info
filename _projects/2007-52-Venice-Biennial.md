First independent Albanian group exhibition held at the Venice Biennial, in Palazzo Malipiero.

>Though not Albanian herself, Clearwater ended up with the gig after a MOCA NoMi docent, who happened to be the mother of American ambassador to Albania Marcie Reis, introduced the director to her daughter, who then recommended Clearwater to exhibition commissioner and vice director of Albania's National Gallery of Arts Rubens Shima.
