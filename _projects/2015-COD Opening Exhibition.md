Opened at the occasion of Angela Merkel's visit. During the same visit, Edi Rama claimed Merkel "inspired" him about the Faith Park.
Besides work by Carsten Höller, Thomas Demand, and Philippe Parreno, the opening exhibition featured and installation by Edit Pulaj and a selection of photographs from the Photo Archives of the ATSh by Zef PAci. Both Höller and Parreno donated their work to the Center for Openness and Dialogue. The installation of Parreno's work on the façade of the Kryeministria has permanently damaged it, in violation of the Law on Cultural Monuments.
