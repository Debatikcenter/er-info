For the construction of a new National Stadium, Edi Rama developed a new strategy to avoid public procurement procedures. The government created a company together with the Albanian Football Association, which received from the state the ownership over the public property of the Qemal Stafa Stadium, officially a Type 2 Cultural Monument and important architectural heritage from the Italian fascist period. This company, Qendra Sportive Kuq e Zi sha, subsequently opened a tender for the demolition of the old stadium and design and construction of the new one, which, because of the legal construction, did not need to meet the governmental transparency and auditing standards. Thus, public property was practically privatized.

The job was granted to Archea Architetti, which in 2009 came in second in a competition for a multipurpose and commercial center near the same site and is the designer of the bankrupt 4 Evergreen Tower, and Atelier 4, Rama's favorite local architecture firm. The construction is undertaken by Alb-Star. Curiously, the contract with Alb-Star was signed by the President of the Albanian Football Association, Armand Duka, and not by the Director of the Qendra Sportive Kuq e Zi sha, which had officially opened the tender.

The architectural plan itself has caused much uproar, first owing the complete destruction and obfuscation of a cultural monument that ought to be protected by the state, second because a multipurpose high-rise building that is part of the stadium. The tactic of including high-rise buildings as lucrative investment objects in every public plan has been part of Rama's urban policies since the adaptation of the "French plan" in 2003, and a similar move was tried by the opposition with the construction of the New Mosque, which originally included a multipurpose tower next to it. Rama's official response to the unusual inclusion of a high-rise building in the stadium design is that "there are other stadiums around the world with towers."
