>Italian collections and international artists unveil Eastern Europe’s ghosts and the specters of its recent history. From 24 January to 16 March, Arte Fiera presents Il Piedistallo vuoto / The Empty Pedestal, Ghosts from the Eastern Europe, a major overview of the contemporary art scene in the post-Soviet nations, hosted in the evocative spaces of Bologna’s Museo Civico Archeologico.

>“But it won’t be an exhibition on nostalgia for the past,” emphasizes curator Marco Scotini, who has since long been following the protagonists of this artistic juncture, organizing many internationally acclaimed  research exhibitions. “Instead, it will be an exhibition on a context still very much alive, a potentiality.” This exhibit’s title alludes to the historical passage, but also a desire, populated by spectres, something that keeps returning, before even having happened.

>Il Piedistallo vuoto / The Empty Pedestal, Ghosts from the Eastern Europe features a cluster of more than 40 artists from 20 Eastern European and former Soviet Union countries presenting a total of 100 works. Starting from the 1970s, the exhibition spans two major periods: 1989 with the fall of the Berlin wall, and 1991 with the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. Twenty years on, we shall see videos, performances, installations, photographs, drawings and paintings by many of the artists ostracized by Socialist culture, flanked by the work of the newest crop of young artists now enjoying worldwide fame.
