The realization of this International Competition was made possible with the financial support of His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait. The implementation of the design remained unfinished when in 2011 Edi Rama lost the municipal elections from PD candidate Lulzim Basha. The square was subsequently quickly reconstructed according to a different urban plan. When Erion Veliaj returned Tirana to the hands of the PS, the 51N4E plan resurfaced in Spring 2016.
