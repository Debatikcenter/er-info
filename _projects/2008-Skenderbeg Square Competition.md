The realization of this International Competition was made possible with the financial support of €4.3M from His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of Kuwait. The implementation of the design, started in March 2010, remained unfinished when in 2011 Edi Rama lost the municipal elections from PD candidate Lulzim Basha. The square was subsequently quickly reconstructed according to a different urban plan. When Erion Veliaj returned Tirana to the hands of the PS, the 51N4E plan resurfaced in Spring 2016.

The [case](https://sheshet.wordpress.com/2008/06/09/con-architects/) of Daniel Libeskind's proposal was interesting, as he basically rehashed a public square proposal from Messina in 2005.
