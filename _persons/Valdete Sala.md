Sala's mother Valdete, which is the subject of Anri Sala's work *Intervista* was a prominent member of the Party of Labor and director of the National Library curing the socialist period. From 1992 until 2005, she was Program Director of the Soros Open Society Foundation in Albania, one of the first international NGOs to open a branch after the fall of the socialist regime. As such, she was very influential in the distribution of international donor money, and funded the MJAFT! movement that would later furnish the Rama government with many of its officials.
