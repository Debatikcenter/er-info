Alastair Campbell [about](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/19/to-be-great-we-need-to-embrace-winners.html) Edi Rama:
>For example, outside the Balkans, people are often stumped by Edi Rama. I’ll tell you why he is there. He is the prime minister of Albania; more relevantly he is the only current head of government in the world to have played sport for his country. He was on Albania’s national basketball team, so a good man to talk to about one of the central themes of the book—what can sport teach us for politics? Answer, as I know from my own experience trying to hold a political team of competing egos, agendas, and ambitions: a lot.
