>Mrs Blair is thought to have first visited Albania in 2010 as the guest of Liri Berisha, the wife of the prime minister at the time, Sali Berisha. Mrs Blair and Mrs Berisha became friends when her husband was still in Downing Street. Mrs Blair flew to the impoverished country in a private jet owned by Rezart Taci, a controversial oil tycoon, and one of Albaniaâ€™s richest men.
