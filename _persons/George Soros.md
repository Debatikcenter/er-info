The (in)direct influence of George Soros and his Open Society Foundation on Albanian politics is difficult to measure. Soros-sponsored organizations stand at the beginning of grassroots political movements such as MJAFT! and its political party offspring G99, thus being largely responsible for the political careers of Erion Veliaj, Milva Ekonomi, Endri Fuga, and Arbjan Mazniku. Indicative of his close ties to Albanian politics is that Edi Rama's first foreign trip as prime minister in September 2013 was to George Soros's third wedding.
