I"ª<p>Presenting the TID Tower.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>51N4E‚Äôs participation, entitled Play for Real, will be exhibited at the Venice biennale 2016 in the Corderie of the Arsenale and will revolve around TID Tower, the largest architectural project ever launched in Albania, that will open this spring. The installation will go beyond the icon by using the project as an entry point to introduce the viewers to the Albanian context and to 51N4E‚Äôs long term involvement in this country since the TID Tower competition in 2004.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Belgian architects Freek Persyn and Johan Anrys of 51N4E write:
Without any firm commitments, we started to travel back and forth between Brussels ‚Äìthe administrative capital of Europe, where all positions have been settled ‚Äì to Tirana, Albania ‚Äì a country notoriously outside of Europe, where positions are still in flux. Our reason was the largest architectural project ever commissioned in the capital city. We moved from one difficult situation to another. At home, strict regulations and procedures limit chances for creative collaborations. In Albania, it was the opposite: the rules are so unclear, implemented so haphazardly, and often avoided altogether. But to our surprise, this improbable situation unleashed unexpected possibilities.
An architecture that is open to any future programme evolved out of this encounter. Within the permeability of boundaries, a new form of dialogue was invented, one that responded to evolving ambitions and was based upon a gradual acquisition of knowledge. The lack of a predefined set of rules forced us to learn in partnership, and to challenge expertise and local capabilities in real-time. A relationship of trust was forged, out of which a shared dream was built; in the place where one would least expect it, we co‚Äêcreated an unlikely icon.</p>
