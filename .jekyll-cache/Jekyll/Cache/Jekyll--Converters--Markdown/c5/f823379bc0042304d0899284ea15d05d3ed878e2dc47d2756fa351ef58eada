I"=<p>As part of Edi Rama’s ambitious project as mayor of Tirana “Return to Idenity,” “Greening and Painting” aimed to intervene in the urban structure by painting the façades of the communist housing blocks in bright colors. This project was captured in  Anri Sala’s famous movie <em>Dammi i colori</em> (2003) with an opening quote by Liam Gillick, “please tell me you don’t have an artist-mayor friend.” <em>Dammi i colori</em> was subsequently included in the “Utopia Station” project by Hans Ulrich Obrist, Molly Nesbit and Rirkrit Tiravanija.</p>
