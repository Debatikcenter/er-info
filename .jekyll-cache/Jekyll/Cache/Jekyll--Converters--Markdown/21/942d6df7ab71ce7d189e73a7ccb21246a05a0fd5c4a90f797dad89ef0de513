<p>The first masterplan competition held under Edi Rama, and was won by Architecture Studio. The masterplan specifically included the following elements:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sk√´nderbeg Square: An additional competition was held, which was won by 51N4E + Anri Sala. The plan was partially executed with Kuwaiti funds, but was aborted in 2011 when Lulzim Basha became mayor of Tirana. In 2016 Erion Veliaj pledged to implement the original designs, including additional park space.</li>
  <li>Mother Theresa Square: No plan was made for the square, which was hastily ‚Äúrestored‚Äù for the visit of Pope Francis in September 2014. It has since become a car-free zone and a square for public events.</li>
  <li>Ten Towers: Of the ten projected towers that were supposed to surround the center of Tirana, only two have been (partially) realized. The TID Tower, designed by 51N4E was opened in 2016, whereas the 4EverGreen Tower (Arcea Architetti) is currently bankrupt. The Eyes of Tirana, a third tower planned between Rr. e Durr√´sit and Rr. e Kavaj√´s, has not yet been started.</li>
  <li>Underground parking: Although attempts have been made to provide public underground parking space, none have been successful so far. Underground parking is once again an integral aspect of the 2016 Tirana Masterplan of Stefano Boeri.</li>
  <li>Museum for Religious Harmony: An architecture competition was organized in 2011 under the title ‚ÄúA Mosque for All,‚Äù which was supposed to include the museum. It was, however, never realized. The idea returned in 2015 under the project title ‚ÄúFaith Park,‚Äù which has been absorbed as ‚ÄúWorld Park‚Äù into the 2016 Tirana Masterplan.</li>
  <li>Train Station: The renovation of the train station and the square in front of it was never realized. In 2012, Grimshaw Architects and DAR Group won Lulzim Basha‚Äôs 2012 Central Tirana Masterplan Competition. Their plan envisioned the extension of the main boulevard northward toward the Tirana river. The train station and surrounding infrastructure was subsequently destroyed.</li>
  <li>The New Ring Road: Owing to expropriation issues, the New Ring was never finished. However, works seem to have restarted in 2016 under Erion Veliaj and completion is expected.</li>
</ol>

<p>The competition for the second stage started on 2005-03-08 <a href="http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showpost.php?p=6775688&amp;postcount=204">http://www.skyscrapercity.com/showpost.php?p=6775688&amp;postcount=204</a></p>

<p>In a critical evaluation of the ‚ÄúFrench masterplan‚Äù architect <a href="https://issuu.com/tiranaworkshop/docs/wim_cuyvers_tirana_houses_and_rubbish">Wim Cuyvers</a> states that</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Architecture Studio failed to see that in the previous ten years the city had experienced a fivefold increase in size, growing in the 1990s from a relatively small city of 200,000 inhabitants into a city of almost a million inhabitants. Even more incredibly, the architects have not seen how special this growth really was and what a special kind of city it has created, not did they realise that this spectacular growth might well be significant, because the collapse had made Tirana a kind of laboratory, and what happened there could be an important test case, with something to say about the world to come.</p>
