  <p><strong>From Bregu i Detit to the Riviera and Back</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The rocky, mountainous stretch of beaches on Albaniaâ€™s southern coastline is referred to by tourism agencies and residents alike as the Riviera. That name, however, didnâ€™t come into existence until after 1991. Previously the region was known as Bregu i Detit (literally, â€œsea coastâ€)â€”the sea-facing side of a coastal mountain rangeâ€”whose altitudinal villages were not maritime in nature but rather the outermost edge of the Laberia; an ancient chain of agricultural settlements based on olives, citrus, and livestock.
New names are meaningful. Riviera implies a very different kind of sea coast, oriented to leisure, and thus an economy based on extracting income from tourism. With the new freedom to move in 1991, the mountain villages were largely abandoned, and subsistence farming was exchanged, practically overnight, for leisureâ€”restaurants and hotels, and the real estate to support it. The leisure economy has required a new urbanization logic too, based on views and proximity to the shoreline, and therefore physically separate from the original villages.
Here, there are indeed two â€œsea-coastsâ€â€”parallel worlds separated by elevation. The Riviera below has adapted to the tourism economy, while the Bregu i detit above remains steadfastly of another timeâ€”out of tune, unable to absorb tourist income. In collaboration with GIZ, the Atelier Albania Summer Academy 2015 is devising strategies to bring the Bregdet into the game; to grow capacities, and begin to direct portions of stagnant local economies toward the service economy.</p>
