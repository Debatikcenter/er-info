I"â<p>For the construction of a new National Stadium, Edi Rama developed a new strategy to avoid public procurement procedures. The government created a company together with the Albanian Football Association, which received from the state the ownership over the public property of the Qemal Stafa Stadium, officially a Type 2 Cultural Monument and important architectural heritage from the Italian fascist period. This company, Qendra Sportive Kuq e Zi sha, subsequently opened a tender for the demolition of the old stadium and design and construction of the new one, which, because of the legal construction, did not need to meet the governmental transparency and auditing standards. Thus, public property was practically privatized.</p>
