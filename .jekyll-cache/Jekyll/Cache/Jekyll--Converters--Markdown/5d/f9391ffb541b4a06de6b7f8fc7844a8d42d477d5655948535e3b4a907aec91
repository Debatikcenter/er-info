I"	<p>A reinterpretation of the 51N4E + Anri Sala plan for SkÃ«nderbeg Square from 2008, this time with a bit more greenery (11 â€œmini parksâ€ that were proposed immediately after the backlash of the park protests) and in alignment with the Faith Park/World Park project of UNLAB and Stefano Boeriâ€™s overhaul of the Tirana Masterplan. A scale model was presented during the exhibition â€œmbi Qiell nÃ«nâ€ in COD.</p>

<p>From Erion Veliajâ€™s announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The natural stones will be in the forms of stone plaques [â€¦] which will be taken from all the lands [trojet] of Albania, starting from Tropoja to KukÃ«s, Bilisht, Librazhd, the quarries of Tirana, KorÃ§a, GjirokastÃ«r, Saranda, Berat, Vlora, Kruja, Bulqiza, Prizren, ErsekÃ«, Skrapar, etc. [â€¦]
As regards the vegetation, the project will bring to the center of Tirana a variety of trees and plants from all over Albania: the green space will be planted with 900 large decorative trees, 520 fruit trees, 954 large shrubs, 4400 small shrubs, and 35,000 flowers.
a public, green space, planted with all the flowers, plants, and trees which are mentioned in the Quâ€™ran and the Bible (and other holy scriptures) [â€¦with] as its center the â€œpyramidâ€ and all green spaces where we aim to create a tangible image of our countryâ€™s religious harmony, including those whom [sic] do not believe.
The central square of Tirana is designed as a void in the chaos of the city, a void shaped by a collection of gardens and public buildings, both existing and new. This surrounding green belt functions like an antechamber, negotiating between the congestion of the city and the emptiness of the square.
From the empty center, the full range of buildings defining Albaniaâ€™s past can be seen, representing a common past that can be built upon. The oppressing monumentality of the communist constructions is countered by the shape of the square: a large, low pyramid. Standing on top of this pyramid, one is no longer overpowered by the architecture of the past. This subtle intervention acknowledges Albaniaâ€™s past, and gives it a new perspective as well.</p>
