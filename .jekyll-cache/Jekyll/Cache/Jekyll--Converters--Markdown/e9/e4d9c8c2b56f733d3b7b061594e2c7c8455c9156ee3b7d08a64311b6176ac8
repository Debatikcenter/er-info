I"¡<p>Question of how Dibbets ever came to Albania and talked to Edi Rama. Inspiration was a similar action in Sarajevo?</p>

<p>In 1998, Jan Dibbets chaired the first international arts competition ‚ÄúOnufri.‚Äù Later, in 1999, he had written to all his friends in the international art circuit, asking to donate works to the National Gallery of Arts ‚Äì which didn‚Äôt have any collection of contemporary art. The donation contained largely multiples, graphical work or photographic prints, by prominent names of conceptual art from the 1960-70s, and arrived, during the Kosovo War and with military convoy, in Tirana in 1999.</p>

<p>Except two exhibitions in ???? and 2011, the Dibbets collection remains largely unseen.</p>
