  <p>The United Kingdom Supreme Court (UKSC) is the nal court of appeal for civil cases of the greatest public or constitutional importance for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The 12 Justices hear criminal ases for England, Wales and Northern Ireland and devolution matters for Scotland. As the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, they also hear cases from some Commonwealth countries.
Opened in 2009, by HM Queen Elizabeth, UKSC now serves the needs of the lawyers, users and Justices â€“ providing three courtrooms, with modern oces and workplaces. It is Great Britainâ€™s international symbol
for justice and the rule of law.
Elsie Owusu will discuss her role as lead architect for the Supreme Court and the relationship between her team and the future Justices as clients and end-users. The talk will describe how the former Middlesex Guildhall in Parliament Square, London, was transformed to become the Supreme Court. It will examine the close collaboration between her architectsâ€™ team at Feilden+Mawson and the many eminent British artists and distinguished makers commissioned to create special designs for this beautiful building.</p>
