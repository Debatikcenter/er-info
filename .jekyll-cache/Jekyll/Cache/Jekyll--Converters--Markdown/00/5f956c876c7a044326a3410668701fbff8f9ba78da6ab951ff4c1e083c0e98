I"|<p>In April 2013, a few months before the general elections, Rapiscan Systems, Redhill, USA, won a 15-year contract to set up control systems at the Albanian borders. This contract was voided by Edi Rama following his election victory, after which Rapiscan turned to the International Chamber of Commerce in Vienna in August 2014 and sued for $350M. In October 2014, after a tendering process, the contract for the defense of the Albanian state was awarded to Omnia Strategies, the firm of Cherie Blair, the wife of Edi Rama’s advisor, former UK PM and war criminal Tony Blair. The initial contract with Omnia Strategies was €495,000, later increased, without formal explanation, with €150,000. The court case ended in a settlement.</p>
