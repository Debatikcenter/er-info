I"Ù<p>Organized by Inke Arns and Andreas Broeckmann during the DEAF Festival in Rotterdam, September 1996.</p>

<p>This event facilitated the first meeting between Geert Lovink and curator Edi Muka. They met another time a year later in Ljubljana during the Nettime conference â€œBeauty and the East,â€ and during Dokumenta X in Kassel in the Hybrid Workspace. Meanwhile, their encounter led to a series of exchanges and reports published on <a href="http://www.nettime.org/">Nettime</a>, which give a fascinating insight into the â€œbeginningsâ€ of the Albanian art scene at the turn of millennium:</p>

<p>According to Edi Mukaâ€™s <a href="http://v2.nl/archive/articles/media-art-in-albania-first-steps/?searchterm=edi%20muka">account</a> of the event, he showed one of Anri Salaâ€™s first video works:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Media art has only just started. I can mention a young artist, his name is Anri Sala, he used to come from a painting background, shifted to installations, worked with photography and has just produced two videos, a 20 minutes long piece called â€˜The Tongueâ€™, which I showed here at DEAF. He also produced a computer show recently.</p>
