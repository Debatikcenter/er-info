<p>Organized in the National Gallery of Arts.
According to the curator:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This exhibition endeavours to display works that illustrate the conscious and subconscious actions of the artist during the process of formation and execution of the work. The works of Onufri 2010 demonstrate through images some of the themes mentioned in the curatorial concept and some of the features of the physiognomy of art and problematic Albanian life. Also in Onufri 2010 we will become aware of the direction the development and identity of young Albanian artists takes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first prize was won by an Art Academy teacher in his late 1950s.</p>
