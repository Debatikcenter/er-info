I"<p>A conference with Edi Muka, Roberto Pinto, Stefano Romano, and Bert Theis in the context of the group exhibition ‚ÄúAbsolute Beginners,‚Äù with artists Jakup Ferri, Armando Lulaj, Anri Sala, and Fani Zguro.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS features four videos by Albanian artists Jakup Ferri, Armando Lulaj, Anri Sala and Fani Zguro. The exhibition‚Äôs paradoxical title, ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS, is essentially tied to the participant artists‚Äô condition at the time of the work‚Äôs production, evoked as evidence of the indefinable, uncertain moment always catalyzed by beginnings. The ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS project set up in ISOLA ART CENTER aims to explore the first steps of artists now operating on an international scale; the exhibition thus offers an unprecedented configuration of research, doubts, transformations, ways sought and found, investigating the possibilities of artistic survival on the contemporary scene, as well as the ambiguous relationship between up-and-coming artists and established figures in the art system.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isola Art Center was situated in the ‚ÄúBohemian‚Äù neighborhood of Milan, as a point of resistance against the continuous threat by real-estate developers. Ironically, it is precisely in the context of such urban gentrification processes that architect and former mayoral candidate Stefano Boeri developed his masterplan for Isola, and erecting his ‚ÄúVertical Forest‚Äù building immediately at its edge. Thus, the architect that threatens the Isola neighborhood with gentrification is the same one Edi Rama has brought to Tirana to restructure its urban fabric.</p>
