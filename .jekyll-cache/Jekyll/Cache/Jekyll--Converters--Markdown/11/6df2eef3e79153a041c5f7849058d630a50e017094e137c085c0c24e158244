<blockquote>
  <p>Edi Rama is likely to feature in the new book as he has been a winner both in sport and politics – I think he is the only current PM or President who has played international sport for his country.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Winners</em> contains an entire chapter on Edi Rama as “team player.”</p>
