I"û<p>Former nuclear bunker of the Central Committee in the outskirts of Tirana, transformed into a tourist attraction by Carlo Bollinoâ€™s Spazio Eventi. The Ministry of Culture accorded a budget of â‚¬100,000 without an official tender procedure. Until March 2016, Bunkâ€™Art was officially managed by the Ministry of Defense, when management was transferred to an NGO â€œQendra Ura,â€ administered by two associates of Carlo Bolino, and with no previous experience in managing cultural heritage sites.</p>
