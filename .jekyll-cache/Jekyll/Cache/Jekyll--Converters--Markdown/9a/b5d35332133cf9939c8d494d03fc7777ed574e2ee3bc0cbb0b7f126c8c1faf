<p>One of the first international NGOs to open a branch in society, the Soros Foundation has had a tremendous influence on Albanian civil society, and the way in which civil society related to politics. Soros stands at the foundation of the Gender Alliance for Development Center (formerly Womenâ€™s Center) (1994), Remzi Laniâ€™s Albanian Media Institute (1995), Piro Mishaâ€™s Institute for Dialogue and Communication (formerly Book &amp; Communication House) (2000), the Albanian Institute for International Studies (2002), the civil society movement MJAFT! (2003), the Agenda Institute (2006), and political party G99 (2008).</p>

<p>An <a href="http://www.goodventures.org/research-and-ideas/conversations/open-society-foundations-albania-october-29-2013">interview</a> from October 2013, just after the official installment of the first Rama Government, with Jonas Rolett, Regional Director of the Open Society Foundation, gives an illuminating insight into the influence that the Soros Foundation has had since its beginnings in 1991 on the current shape of Albanian politics:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OSF has been working in Albania for 22 years. It recently launched a new initiative related to government capacity building. OSF has long-standing relationships with many members of the new government. The prime minister is a former board member of OSFâ€™s local foundation in Tirana and roughly half of the cabinet have worked with OSF as grantees, partners, recipients of scholarships to study abroad, or debaters supported by the local foundation.</p>
