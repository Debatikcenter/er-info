  <p>The “Palastgalerie” in Berlin shows “Die Spielchen des Freund Hein / The Little Games of Mr. Joe Black”
This is most likely going to be the most exciting, most spectacular and maybe most scandalous exhibition of 2015 in Berlin: The “Palastgalerie”, in cooperation with RAR Gallery, shows “Die Spielchen des Freund Hein / The Little Games of Mr Joe Black”, curated by Gerhard Charles Rump, on the subject of death and transitoriness, in which more than 20 international contemporary artists treat this highly topical subject.
“Once a human being comes to life, it is old enough to die” – we may almost have thought this wisdom from “Death and the Ploughman” (Johannes von Saaz, around 1400) had no value any more, but suicidal pilots an terror groups like Al Qaida, Boko Haram, and the IS teach us better. Death, whether we want it like that or not, is closer to us today than ever. Even TV series treat the subject of the varied ways of biting the dust, just like “Der Höllische Proteus (The Proteus of Hell) by Erasmus Francisci, published in Nuremberg in 1690. So nothing really has changed in the course of history…
What’s fascinating in this show is how many different aspects are treated in the individual works: concrete, symbolic, contemptuous, full of resignation, remembering, melancholy a.s.o. An exhibition that looks deep into the human condition, and in which we find deliberately provocative statements to make things clear.  (G.C. Rump)
