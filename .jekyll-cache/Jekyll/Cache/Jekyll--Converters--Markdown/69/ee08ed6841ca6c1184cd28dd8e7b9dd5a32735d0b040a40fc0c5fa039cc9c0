  <p>Friday 23 May 2008, Albania was shocked to hear about the sudden death of Dritan Hoxha. He was only 40 years old, and will be remembered as the founder of a media empire that made a great contribution to the opening of Albanian society.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>His grave, sited in the midst of Tiranaâ€™s biggest cemetery, commemorates him by creating a space only accessible to his family and friends. Entirely built out of white enameled glass, it almost reads as an absence, a white spot amidst the chaos of the cemetery. Once inside, the bright Mediterranean sun paints shadows on the slightly translucent glass, making everyday reality come to a stop.</p>
