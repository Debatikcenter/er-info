  <p>Tirana Open is a NGO, based in Tirana with focus on a variety of developments on contemporary culture, and promotion of these developments in various forms, where one of the foremost is the great festive event (annual) that gathers under a roof visual arts, architecture, book, film and music, to make it accessible to a wider public the latest updates on these areas.
Bearing in mind the international culture and not only that local, we strive to raise a broader dialogue between people and culture institutions, which promises a significant climate cultural exchange.</p>

  <p><em>Introduction of the Minister of Culture, Mirela Kumbaro</em>
Art, books, music, films, opera, education, and not only these creative activities, are intricate to take place all together on one stage, in one city during one week.
Yet, it is difficult to not follow this temptation, desire, and passion, to take upon this challenge.
Thus, when people team up with the desire to go beyond the borders of a city, beyond prejudice, beyond the limits of thinking, there can be established an Open Festival, where there is a place for everyone and everything.
This city that has quadrupled its population in the last 20 years, has a limitless energy, which frequently, has had no space for its expressions, a talented youth full of new ideas, who even when there are no right circumstances it still finds a window to communicate.
Tirana Open is a space where diverse mediums of art, various artists of the City, small and large stages, local cultural and international actors, can meet, intertwine and brilliantly challenge each other.
Through Tirana Open, the City invites the public and culture to dialog through the book as a value and not just simply as a product, through visual arts which assert a new market of values, through music which dares to beat with the voice of drama, through movies which are competitive and not just passive screens, through architecture as an inherited culture but also as a contesting experimental lab.
Famous persons, special guests, courageous artists, public institutions, independent movements, public initiatives, new audiences, challenging perspectives, traditional critics, professional skeptics, unsettled writers, encouraging  jealousy, passive spectators, random passengers in the capital city, slogan fans, lovers of social spaces, virtual and energetic ‚Äúvoyeurs‚Äù, endorsed in search of the self, emerging passionate journalists, after work walkers and the curious of the open windows, optimistic dreamers, are all welcome at Tirana Open!
This city, as we wish to have it, has a place for everyone! TiranaOpen is an open cultural invitation, where the Ministry of Culture, is pleased, as it has encouraged since its establishment as a Ministry dedicated to culture, to continue to support courageous incentives and alternative cultural perspectives in the city, in which are blowing the wind of Albania of the Next Generation!</p>
